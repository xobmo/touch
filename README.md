This is a demonstration of the haptic grid texture concept. There are three primary components, two visual and one functional.

1. Image display with mouse cursor (on the left)
2. Zoomed-in view of 4 x 4 pixels (on the right)
3. Streaming output to virtual COM port via USB

As the user moves the mouse cursor over the image on the left, the 16 pixels under the cursor are displayed in a zoomed-in
view on the right. Underneath this view is an array of pixel intensity/color values in numeric form (0-255). As those values change, they are streamed out over the virtual COM port as text.
